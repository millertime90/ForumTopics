In Spring Security, the logout process is made fairly straightforward. Let's break down the steps:

Configure Logout in SecurityConfig:

You need to configure logout settings in your SecurityConfig class. Since you already have a basic configuration there, you can expand upon the logout method:

java
Copy code
.logout(logout -> logout
    .logoutUrl("/logout")              // The URL to trigger logout. This is a default and can be omitted unless you want a different URL.
    .clearAuthentication(true)         // Clears authentication attributes
    .invalidateHttpSession(true)       // Invalidates HTTP Session
    .deleteCookies("JSESSIONID")       // Deletes the session cookie
    .logoutSuccessUrl("/index")        // URL to redirect to after successful logout
)
Create the Logout Button:

In your HTML, you can create a logout button or link. When clicked, this button/link should send a POST request to the logout URL (typically /logout).

html
Copy code
<form action="/logout" method="post">
    <button type="submit">Logout</button>
</form>
Note: The logout action should be a POST request due to security reasons. GET requests can be cached, prefetched, or triggered accidentally just by following a link, which can inadvertently log out a user.

Optional - AJAX Logout:

If you want to handle logout with AJAX:

javascript
Copy code
$("#logoutButton").on("click", function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        url: "/logout",
        success: function(response) {
            // Handle successful logout, e.g., redirect to the login page
            window.location.href = "/index";
        },
        error: function(xhr, status, error) {
            console.error("Logout failed:", error);
        }
    });
});
Make sure to update the button's ID to "logoutButton" or whatever you choose.

Session Timeout:

If you wish for the session to time out after a certain period of inactivity, you can configure that in your application.properties or application.yml. For example:

properties
Copy code
server.servlet.session.timeout=30m
This will make sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.

By setting up these steps, you'll be able to allow users to manually log out, and if you set a session timeout, their session will be invalidated after the specified period of inactivity.
